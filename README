0. For this assignment, I worked together with my classmates.
*************************************************************************************
How to run this:tpye ./script in cmd,      
	this will go to apps directory and run the make file and then the test01 file and then hexdump -C vdisk then run test02 then hexdump -C vdisk the new vdisk(which is empty).
	you need to scroll the screen to see the whole stuff.

vdisk will be in /apps
/apps contains Makefile,test    /io contains File.c,File.h
*************************************************************************************
1. design
directory apps contains test.c and Makefile
directory io contains File.c and 
block[0] is super block.

block[1] is the block vector. if transmit each byte into binary,
then 1 means usable, 0 means unusable. First ten bits are unusable.

block[2] to block[5] are using for directories. A directory needs the whole block.

block[6] to block[9] are using for inodes.

block[10] to block[4095] are using for data.
*************************************************************************************
2. test file
test01.c test the createdisk,readfile,writefile,create sub directory,changedirectory etc.
test02.c test the creation of the vdisk.

3.tradeoffs
I didn't implement delete file.
The datas can only be witten in contiguous blocks. Tried to wirte in uncontiguous blocks
but failed.
